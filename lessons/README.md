# Lessons

There are serveral lessons put together for usage of this kit in a classroom setting.

If you are just looking to connect to the hyperlocal weather station network, visit [lesson 8](lesson8.md).

The lessons are split into three parts. Lesson one is a basic tutorial and introduces students to the arduino IDE for the first time. Lessons 2-5 go through the creation of a simple arduino based weather station that reports temperature and humidity data using an LCD panel. Lessons 6-8 go through the creation of a complex hyperlocal weather network using a raspberry pi. Links to each lesson are found below. You can also select each lesson from right inside this directory.

##### Introduction:

* [Lesson 1: Setting up Arduino IDE](lesson1.md)

##### Simple station setup:
* [Lesson 2: Setting up the Humidity & Temp Sensor](lesson2.md)
* [Lesson 3: Learning the basics of coding](lesson3.md)
* [Lesson 4: Weather station functions](lesson4.md)
* [Lesson 5: Simple weather station creation](lesson5.md)

##### Complex station setup:
* [Lesson 6: Setting up the arduino for acomplex weather station](lesson6.md)
* [Lesson 7: Setting up the raspberry pi server](lesson7.md)
* [Lesson 8: How to connect to a weather Station](lesson8.md)
