# Lesson 6: Setting up the raspberry pi server (~30 mins)

In this lesson, you will learn how to setup a simple Raspberry Pi server.

Servers are quite complex in nature, so most of the heavy lifting has been done
for you, you will just need to set it.

## Step 1: Flashing the ISO
The Raspberry Pi comes with a built-in micro SD slot, so we need to install the server on it.
A image file (.iso) has been prepared with all the required software to run the server,
all you have to do is install it.
