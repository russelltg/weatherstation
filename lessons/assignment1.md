# Assignment One

Please complete this after lesson 3.

Your task is to make the serial monitor print a paragraph. Below is the output the code should produce. Make sure the code waits 3 seconds after it prints each line. You should should use the information from tutorial 3 to complete this.

### Example outputs

```
Hello World!
This is arduino code
It is currently printing to the serial monitor
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
This is a looped message
...
```

> *NOTE: `This is a looped message` needs to be printed to the serial monitor forever, or as long as the arduino is on. Make sure that **only** this message loops*

Good luck!
