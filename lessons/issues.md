# How to fix arduino issues!

If something isn't working with the arduino, there are a few things you can do.

* Unplug the arduino from the computer and the arduino itself. Plug it back in a few seconds later. This will usually fix the issue.

* Unplug the arduino and plug it into a different port. Check `Tools`->`Port` to make sure the arduino is connected.

* Check `Tools`->`Board` and make sure the board selected is the same as the one you have. More than likely, it will say `Arduino/ Genuino UNO`. This is more than likely what it should be, but you should still check the type of board you have to make sure this is correct.

* Save your progress and close the arduino software. Restart it a few seconds later

* If all else fails, unplug the arduino, close the software, and restart the computer. This should fix any issues.

>  If none of these fix your problem, try a combination of things. For instance, change the port ***and*** restart the software.
